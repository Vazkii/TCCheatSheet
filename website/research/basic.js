Some believe it is the accumulated life force of living beings, while others believe it to be merely another type of energy seeping in from another place. The last theory seems to be most likely, as the aura is often found surrounding a node of concentrated mystical energy known as an Aura Node.<br>Each aura node has a base amount of magical energy it can contain and this energy is aligned into one or more aspects. It is usually aligned to Primal Aspects, but rarely a node may contain Compound Aspects.<br>The aspects within an aura node can be tapped by a thaumaturge for his own purposes, The simplest way to do so is with the use of a wand.<br>Energy that has been harvested in this manner is known as vis.<hr>Aura nodes are hard to see with the naked eye, but faint glimmers of light often betray their presence. The Thaumometer makes nodes slightly easier to find, as looking through its lens makes them clearly visible.<br>Important: Caution must be taken when draining a node. There is a small chance that when a specific type of aspect within a node is completely drained, it may disappear or harm the integrity of the node.<br>It is possible for the node to disappear completely if all the aspects disappear.<hr>Fortunately most nodes replenish their aspects over time and if properly maintained can provide a clever thaumaturge with all the vis he could want."

The simplest comound aspects are made from two primal aspects, but it is possible to have incredibly complex compound aspects made from successive layers of simpler aspects.<br>The simplest example of such a compound aspect, is the aspect if Victus (life) that is a combination of Terra and Aqua.<br>To view what aspects an item possesses, simply hover your cursor over the item and press sneak (shift), and you will see what aspects that item has and what amounts of each.

		description: "Before you can build most thaumaturgical items and blocks, you first need to discover how to do so. There are several steps in this process:<br>(<b>1</b>) Exploring the world and examining blocks, items and creatures with a Thaumometer.<br>(<b>2</b>) Taking the research points you gathered from the first step and expanding your aspect knowledge with the Research Table.<br>(<b>3</b>) Using the aspects you know and discovering practical knowledge and recipes with the Research Table<br><br><u>(1) Exploration</u><br>You cannot perform research without research points, and the best way to gain research points is by exploration and examining object in the world.<br>The first thing you will need to do is construct a Thaumometer (see next page). By pointing the Thaumometer at objects or creatures and holding the right mouse button you will start examining them. The process does not take long but your movement speed is reduces while it is occurring.<br>Once the Thaumometer will display what aspects the object contains. In the bottom right of the screen you will also see a summary of the aspects and research points you discovered.<br><img src = 'http://puu.sh/4JVmu.jpg'></img><br>You will initially not be able to examine all objects since you have not discovered their component aspects. For example, a object containing the Lux aspect can only be examined if you have previously discovered the Lux aspect, or know the two aspects that combine to create it.<br>The very first time you discover an aspect by examining something you gain double the number of research points you would have normally.<br>Objects and creatures can usually only be examined once.<br>While exploring the world and examining things it is always a good idea to keep a filled set of scribing tools and some paper on you. Occasionally examining something will reveal additional clues and insights into thaumoturgical research, often resulting in a set of research notes that you can research further.<br><br><u>(2) Combining Aspects</u><br>Once you have gathered some research points you can attempt to combine them into compound aspects within a research table.<br>To craft a research table simply place two tables next to each other and click on them with a set of Scribing Tools. The recipe for tables is listed under the Artiface research category.<br>If you open the research tables inventory, you will see an interface as pictured on the right.<br>The cribing tools you used to craft the table will be located in slot <b>1</b>. You might also wish to place paper into slot <b>2</b>., though paper is not needed for this phase of research.<br><img src = 'http://puu.sh/4JVym.jpg'></img><br>You should see all the primal aspects (and possibly some compound aspects) listed in the area marked <b>3</b> with varying amounts attached to them. When you enter a world for the first time, every player is assigned a small pool of primal aspects to get them started.If you had done some exploring with the Thaumometer beforehand then you might have a significant number of primal and compound aspects listed here.<br>You can now start combining aspects into more complex compound aspects but simply clicking on those you wish to combine, the selected aspects will appear in slot <b>4</b> and when you have two selected pressing the purple button marked <b>5</b> will attempt to combine them. If successful, you should see what was gained in the bottom right and it should appear in slot <b>3</b>.<br>The component aspects are consumed even if the combination did not result in a valid compound aspect.<br><br><u>(3) Research Aspects</u><br><img src = 'http://puu.sh/4JVK3.jpg'></img><br>If you have paper is slot <b>2</b>, then you may have noticed that when only a single aspect is selected that the green button (marked <b>6</b>) lights up.<br>If you press it then you will attempt to research the selected aspect. If successful you discover something of interest about that aspect and a set of research notes will appear in slot <b>7</b>. Section <b>8</b> will also display the research sheet covered in a bewildering array of runes and symbols that looks something like the image at the top of the previous page.<br>Don't worry, it is not as hard as it looks.<hr>To complete your research you simply need to connect and activate all the knowledge nodes (pictured below).<br><img src = 'http://puu.sh/4JVNa.jpg'></img><br>The node on the left is an inactive node, while the node on the right has been activated. Once all the inactive nodes have become active, the research will be complete and the research note will change into a discovery that you can use to gain the completed research (just right click while holding it).<hr>You connect the knowledge nodes by activating the runes.<br><img src = 'http://puu.sh/4JVPO.jpg'></img><br>Each rune is linked to a aspect, but at first it us unknown which rune represents which aspect. The rune/aspect link is unique to each research subject, so a rune that might represent Aer the time, might represent Terra next time.<br>Not all the runes are valid for the current subject you are researching.<br>For example though ther emight be runes for Aer, Terra, Ignes and Aqua on the research sheet, only Ignes and Terra mght actually be valid. Invalid runes are often called 'red herring' runes.<br>You discover which runes are valid by selecting an aspect on the left, and pressing the 'Research' button (<b>6</b>). If the aspect you selected is valid, then all runes linked to that aspect will become active.<br>If the aspect you select is a 'red herring' then the runes linked to it will not activate, but up to two of them will be removed from the sheet entirely.<br>If the aspect you select is not present on the research table then nothing happens.<hr>Active runes act as possible bridges to connect knowledge nodes. A glowing line of energy will glow from an active knowledge node to any active rune nearby. You need to create a chain of active runes and ndes to complete the research.<br><img src = 'http://puu.sh/4JVYN.jpg'></img><br>A chain cannot form if there is more than one open space between a active runes or nodes.<br>To form a chain you must move the runes aqround by clicking on a rune and selecting a valid destination.<br><img src ='http://puu.sh/4JW0J.jpg'></img><br>Each rune can be moved up to 2 positions in a straight line, but only inactive runes can be moved - this means you might have to activate and deactivate your valid runes several times to get them into position.<br>Inactive runes prevent the forming of a connection if they lie in its path, so you need to move them out of the way.<br><img src = 'http://puu.sh/4JW3V.jpg'></img><br>Moving runes uses a small amount of ink each time you do it."
